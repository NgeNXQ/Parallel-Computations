High technology, often abbreviated as high tech, refers to technology that is at the cutting edge and represents the highest level of complexity or innovation available1. It can be defined as either the most complex or the newest technology on the market1. High tech is a term generally applied to economic and industrial sectors where technological innovation is emphasized.

High tech industries play an important role in the modern economy and often experience significantly higher pay than other industries2. These industries have experienced significant economic growth since the 1950s, although they have often been the subject of several economic bubbles, especially since the advent of the world wide web.

The term “high tech” is also used in contrast to “low technology”, which refers to simple, often traditional or mechanical technology. For example, a slide rule is a low-tech calculating device1. When high tech becomes old, it becomes low tech.

Startups working on high technologies or developing new high technologies are sometimes referred to as deep tech1. High-tech, as opposed to high-touch, may refer to self-service experiences that do not require human interaction.

There has been a shift in high tech employment from manufacturing to services in recent years2. High tech is also related to the concept of mid-tech, which is a balance between the two opposite extreme qualities of low-tech and high-tech.

In terms of global high tech exports, China, Hong Kong, Germany, United States, and South Korea are among the top exporters.
